        <h1>Why I Sauna 5 Days a Week (And What My Data Says About It)</h1>
      </div>

      <p>
        I started using the sauna consistently about a year ago. Not the "sit in the gym steam room for 5 minutes after a workout" kind. A deliberate protocol: 185&deg;F, 20 minutes, 4&ndash;5 times a week, always after training.
      </p>

      <p>
        It started because I kept seeing the same Finnish study referenced everywhere &mdash; in longevity podcasts, cardiology papers, biohacking forums. The data was hard to ignore. So I decided to run my own experiment.
      </p>

      <h2>The Finnish Study That Started Everything</h2>

      <p>
        In 2015, researchers published a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2130724" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landmark prospective cohort study in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em></a> that followed 2,315 middle-aged Finnish men for over 20 years. They tracked sauna frequency against cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and the results were striking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Men who used the sauna 4&ndash;7 times per week had a 63% lower risk of sudden cardiac death compared to those who went once a week. Fatal cardiovascular disease risk dropped by 50%. And the benefits were dose-dependent &mdash; more sessions, lower risk. Duration mattered too: sessions longer than 19 minutes were associated with roughly half the risk of sudden cardiac death compared to sessions under 11 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6262976/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up study in 2018</a> expanded the findings to include women with similar results. The relationship between frequency and reduced cardiovascular mortality was linear &mdash; no plateau, no threshold effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        For someone like me &mdash; managing elevated cardiovascular risk on an aggressive prevention protocol &mdash; these numbers got my attention.
      </p>

      <h2>My Protocol</h2>

      <p>
        Nothing complicated. After my training session, I hit the sauna 4&ndash;5 days a week. Traditional dry sauna, 185&deg;F, 20 minutes. I sit, I breathe, I don't look at my phone. Some days it's meditative. Most days it's just hot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hydration is non-negotiable. I drink 20+ ounces of water before I go in, and I follow up with electrolytes after &mdash; specifically something with magnesium. You lose a lot of fluid at 185&deg;F for 20 minutes, and sweating depletes magnesium faster than most people realize. Magnesium is involved in muscle recovery, sleep quality, and heart rhythm, so if you're doing regular sauna sessions without replenishing it, you're working against yourself. I either supplement magnesium directly or make sure my electrolyte mix includes it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The timing matters to me. Post-training sauna extends the window where your body is already in a heightened recovery and adaptation state. Heat stress triggers heat shock proteins &mdash; molecular chaperones that help repair damaged and misfolded proteins in your cells. Your muscles are already dealing with exercise-induced damage; HSPs accelerate that repair process. There's also a well-documented growth hormone response to heat exposure. One study showed that repeated sauna sessions can increase growth hormone levels several-fold, and stacking that on top of a post-workout spike creates a compounding effect.
      </p>

      <h2>What My Sleep Data Shows</h2>

      <p>
        Here's where it gets interesting. I've been tracking my sleep with NeuroRest since it launched, which gives me months of data to compare sauna days against non-sauna days.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result: my sleep quality is about 3% better on days I sauna versus days I don't.
      </p>

      <p>
        Three percent doesn't sound dramatic. But in the context of sleep metrics, it's a consistent, repeatable signal across dozens of data points &mdash; not a one-night fluke. It shows up primarily in two ways: I sleep longer on sauna days, and my sleep is less fragmented &mdash; fewer wake-ups, fewer restless periods through the night. My body seems to settle in and stay asleep more consistently.
      </p>

      <p>
        This aligns with what the research suggests. Heat exposure activates the parasympathetic nervous system &mdash; the "rest and digest" side. Your body works hard to cool itself down during and after a sauna session, and that thermoregulatory process appears to prime the body for sleep. There's some evidence that the post-sauna drop in core body temperature mimics the natural cooling that occurs as part of your circadian sleep onset.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm not claiming the sauna is a sleep hack. But the data is consistent enough that I notice when I skip it.
      </p>

      <h2>What Else Regular Sauna Use Does</h2>

      <p>
        The Finnish study focused on mortality, but the benefits of regular heat exposure go beyond heart health.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Your blood vessels get a workout.</strong> Repeated sauna use improves the flexibility and function of your arteries &mdash; essentially helping them dilate and contract more efficiently. For someone managing cardiovascular risk, that's directly relevant.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>There's an anti-inflammatory effect.</strong> Regular heat exposure appears to lower baseline levels of chronic inflammation &mdash; the kind that drives heart disease, metabolic issues, and accelerated aging. Think of it as turning down the background noise your immune system is producing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>It may help your brain.</strong> Some of the Finnish research found that frequent sauna users had lower rates of dementia and Alzheimer's, though this is still early. The working theory is that the cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory benefits extend to the brain's blood supply.
      </p>

      <p>
        One nuance worth mentioning: there's ongoing debate about whether post-exercise heat therapy might dampen some of the inflammation your body needs to build muscle &mdash; similar to how taking ibuprofen after every workout can interfere with strength gains over time. I haven't noticed any negative impact on my training progress. If anything, I recover faster on sauna days. But it's worth being aware of if you're chasing maximal hypertrophy.
      </p>

      <h2>Is It the Sauna or Is It the Routine?</h2>

      <p>
        Fair question. Part of what makes the sauna effective for me might just be that it forces 20 minutes of stillness at the end of a training session. No screen, no tasks, no input. In a life where I'm constantly building, tracking, optimizing &mdash; that pause has value on its own.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the Finnish data doesn't care about mindfulness. Those mortality curves are based on physiological responses to heat stress: improved vascular compliance, reduced blood pressure, enhanced cardiac output, upregulated cellular repair mechanisms. The relaxation is a bonus. The biology is the point.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        I'm not a doctor, and sauna protocols aren't medical advice. If you have cardiovascular conditions, talk to your cardiologist before sitting in a 185&deg;F room for 20 minutes &mdash; that's a serious physiological stressor.
      </p>

      <p>
        But for me, the combination of strong epidemiological evidence, measurable improvements in my sleep data, and the subjective feeling of better recovery makes this one of the easiest additions to my health stack. Four to five sessions a week, 20 minutes, after training. Simple, repeatable, and the data &mdash; both mine and the Finns' &mdash; supports it.
      </p>

      <div class="divider">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>

      <p>
        <em>This is why building NeuroRest mattered to me. Without months of consistent sleep and recovery data, I'd be guessing about whether the sauna actually makes a difference. With it, I can see the 3% &mdash; small, steady, real.</em>
