        I spent 25 years in tech — engineering, sales, leadership. Nine years running an MEP engineering firm. Stints at Cisco and HashiCorp. A few years ago, real estate investing gave me the financial independence to step back and ask: what do I actually want to build?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The answer surprised me. Health apps.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        At 51, I've been managing a thyroid condition for 15 years. More recently, I learned I have elevated cardiovascular risk that put me on an aggressive prevention protocol. I train six days a week. I track everything. And I kept running into the same problem: the tools available didn't match how I think about my own health data.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So I built what I wanted. NeuroRest for sleep and recovery. FuelSense for nutrition. Both live in the App Store now under Longevity Health Analytics.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Here's the thing — I'm not a developer. I have a technical background, but I'd never written Swift or built an iOS app. Claude and ChatGPT changed that. I had the domain knowledge and the vision for what these tools should do. AI was the bridge that let me actually build them.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Now I'm going deeper. Running my own experiments, tracking the data, learning what works for me. And I've decided to share the journey — the protocols, the results, the decisions I'm working through in real time.
      </p>
